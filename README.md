# Green Dragon Consulting
As part of the Grand Canyon University Software Development certificate program, we have our students work in situations commonly found in a real-world development team.  That includes understanding the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).  

## Project Overview
This project came from previous homework exercises. The students broke into teams of three and worked with the instructor to identify the requirements.  What they found was that getting precise requirements is not always guaranteed. Then they broke those requirements into Agile user stories and finally into sized work tasks. Like a programmer working in the industry, they pulled their tasks and forked the central repository. Some teams broke their work in database, administration, and coding.  Other groups had tasks that encompassed multiple files and classes. As they worked on code, they learned the value of working in your area on a specific job.  When you code across large patches, the merge back into the central repository becomes a lot harder.

They were not done when they completed their sprint, stories, and tasks.  Just as would happen in a real-world environment, the business owner, or in our case, the instructor, added some new features.  Although no team said "no," they were told that development teams should question changes.  Some changes need to be moved to future releases so the project can complete. Instead, the teams worked the added features and refactored their code to include the necessary changes.

## Practical Software Project Expereinces
Our Java certificate participants work on projects from planning to maintainence.  This project encompassed the following development pieces from an Agile Methodology perspective:
- Planning
- Prioritzing
- Database design (Mysql on AWS)
- Coding (Java / JDBC)
- Task lists (Agile)
- User stories (Agile)
- Daily stand-ups (Agile)
- Testing (JUnit)
- Collaborating (GitHub)
- Deploying (AWS)
- Refactoring
- Maintenence

## Tools
Justing learning the syntax of Java code can be over-whelming enough.  But to prepare our Java certificate students for their first meaningful job in software development, we have to teach them some of the tool they will be using.
- Eclipse
- Java JDK
- Git and GitHub
- MySql and MySql Workbench
- JUnit
- Amazon Web Services (AWS)
